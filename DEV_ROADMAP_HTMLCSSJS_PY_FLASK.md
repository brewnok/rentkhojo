Here’s a suggested development roadmap for your Tenant and Owner Management System using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, Python Flask for the backend, and MySQL for the database:

---

## **Development Roadmap**

### **1. Project Setup**
- **Objective**: Set up the foundational structure for the project.
  - Install and configure Python Flask.
  - Set up a MySQL database.
  - Create a Git repository for version control.
  - Define the folder structure for the backend, frontend, and database scripts.

---

### **2. Backend Development**
#### **Step 2.1: Flask Setup**
- Create a Flask project structure:
  ```
  /backend
    ├── app.py (main entry point)
    ├── routes/
    │   ├── auth_routes.py
    │   ├── tenant_routes.py
    │   ├── owner_routes.py
    │   ├── room_routes.py
    ├── models/
    │   ├── db.py (database connection setup)
    │   ├── tenant_model.py
    │   ├── owner_model.py
    │   ├── room_model.py
    ├── templates/
    ├── static/
    │   ├── css/
    │   ├── js/
    │   ├── images/
  ```

#### **Step 2.2: Database Integration**
- Configure MySQL with Flask using `SQLAlchemy` or `PyMySQL`.
- Write database models for:
  - Tenants
  - Owners
  - Rooms

#### **Step 2.3: RESTful APIs**
- Develop APIs to handle:
  - **Authentication**:
    - Login for tenants and owners.
    - Registration for tenants and owners.
  - **Room Management**:
    - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for room details.
    - Fetch available rooms for tenants.
  - **Profile Management**:
    - View and edit profiles for tenants and owners.

#### **Step 2.4: Media Upload and Management**
- Integrate functionality to handle photo uploads using `Flask-Uploads` or `Flask-S3`.
- Store media files in the structured directory format:
  - `tenant/` and `owner/`.

---

### **3. Frontend Development**
#### **Step 3.1: Design Layout**
- Create wireframes for key screens:
  - Login/Registration
  - Room Search (Tenant view)
  - Room Dashboard (Owner view)
  - Room Details Page
  - Profile Page

#### **Step 3.2: Develop Frontend**
- Use **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to implement the designs.
- Use frameworks/libraries like:
  - **Bootstrap** or **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design.
  - **Axios** or **Fetch API** for making API calls.

#### **Step 3.3: Tenant-Specific Features**
- Implement room search functionality:
  - Filter by room type, price, and location.
- Display room details in a carousel format.

#### **Step 3.4: Owner-Specific Features**
- Implement a dashboard to:
  - Add, edit, and delete room details.
  - Mark rooms as "Free" or "Rented".
  - Upload room photos.

---

### **4. Authentication**
#### **Step 4.1: Implement Login and Registration**
- Use Flask's `Flask-WTF` for form handling.
- Enable OTP verification for secure login and registration.

#### **Step 4.2: Authorization**
- Use session or token-based authentication for securing endpoints.

---

### **5. Integration and Testing**
#### **Step 5.1: Backend and Frontend Integration**
- Connect the frontend with Flask APIs.
- Test API endpoints for:
  - Data retrieval and updates.
  - Error handling.

#### **Step 5.2: End-to-End Testing**
- Test the full user flow:
  - Tenant: Search for rooms and view details.
  - Owner: Manage room listings and upload photos.

---

### **6. Deployment**
#### **Step 6.1: Backend Deployment**
- Use platforms like AWS, Heroku, or PythonAnywhere to host the Flask app.

#### **Step 6.2: Frontend Deployment**
- Host the frontend using platforms like Netlify or Vercel.

#### **Step 6.3: Database Hosting**
- Host the MySQL database on cloud services like AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL.

---

### **7. Maintenance and Updates**
- Monitor application performance and fix bugs.
- Gather user feedback for future enhancements.

---

### **Timeline (Estimation)**
- **Week 1-2**: Project setup, backend models, and API development.
- **Week 3-4**: Frontend design and basic features implementation.
- **Week 5-6**: API integration and full-stack testing.
- **Week 7**: Deployment and user acceptance testing.
- **Ongoing**: Maintenance and feature updates.
