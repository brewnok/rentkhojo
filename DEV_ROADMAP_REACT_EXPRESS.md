## **Recommended Tech Stack For rentkhojo**
### **Frontend**: 
**React.js**
- React provides a component-based architecture, reusable UI components, and efficient state management.
- React has a large developer community, rich ecosystem, and libraries like **Material-UI**, **Ant Design**, or **Tailwind CSS** for building responsive UIs.

### **Backend**: 
**Node.js with Express.js**
- Express is lightweight, fast, and flexible for building REST APIs.
- Node.js is highly scalable and performs well with concurrent requests, which is useful for real-time search and updates in your app.

### **Database**:
**PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**
- Both are relational databases suitable for structured data like tenants, owners, and rooms.
- **PostgreSQL** offers advanced features like JSONB for semi-structured data and is highly scalable.
- **MySQL** is widely used, has rich documentation, and is slightly easier to start with for simpler use cases.

### **File Storage**:
**Cloud Storage (e.g., AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage)**
- Storing images (ID cards, selfies, and room photos) in a scalable cloud storage solution is better than keeping them on local servers. 

### **Authentication**:
**JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for session management or OAuth2 for third-party logins (if needed).
- JWT provides secure, stateless authentication.

### **Other Tools**:
- **Frontend State Management**: Redux Toolkit or React Context API.
- **Backend ORM**: Sequelize (for SQL databases).
- **Image Upload/Processing**: Multer or Cloudinary.
- **Deployment**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Vercel for React.

## **Roadmap**

### **1. Initial Setup**
#### Objective:
- Define the architecture, select libraries, and set up the development environment.
1. **Frontend**:
   - Initialize a React project using `npx create-react-app` or Vite.
   - Set up routing with **React Router**.
   - Install UI libraries (e.g., Material-UI or Tailwind CSS).
2. **Backend**:
   - Initialize a Node.js project using `npm init`.
   - Set up Express.js and install required libraries (`express`, `sequelize`, `jsonwebtoken`, etc.).
   - Configure a MySQL/PostgreSQL database.
3. **Version Control**:
   - Set up GitHub or GitLab for version control and collaboration.

---

### **2. Backend Development**
#### Objective:
- Build APIs for managing tenants, owners, rooms, and user authentication.
1. **Database Design**:
   - Create schemas for tenants, owners, and rooms.
   - Configure Sequelize models and relationships.
2. **API Development**:
   - Develop RESTful APIs for:
     - Authentication (register/login).
     - CRUD operations for tenants, owners, and rooms.
     - Fetch rooms based on location, type, and availability.
   - Implement middleware for validation and authentication.
3. **File Upload**:
   - Use **Multer** for handling file uploads.
   - Integrate with AWS S3 or Cloudinary for storing and serving images.

---

### **3. Frontend Development**
#### Objective:
- Build a user-friendly interface for tenants and owners.
1. **Authentication Pages**:
   - Create login and registration forms.
   - Add OTP verification UI (if required).
2. **Tenant Features**:
   - Develop a search page with filters for room type, price, and location.
   - Display search results in a card/grid format with room photos and details.
   - Room detail page with a photo carousel.
3. **Owner Features**:
   - Create a dashboard to manage room listings (add/edit/delete).
   - Implement toggles for marking rooms as "Rented" or "Free."
   - Add photo upload forms for room images.
4. **Global State Management**:
   - Use **Redux Toolkit** or React Context API to manage user sessions and app state.

---

### **4. Integration**
#### Objective:
- Connect frontend and backend for full functionality.
1. **API Integration**:
   - Use **Axios** or **Fetch API** to consume backend APIs in React.
   - Manage tokens for authentication (store in HttpOnly cookies or localStorage).
2. **Dynamic Components**:
   - Populate the tenant's search results dynamically based on API responses.
   - Display owner's dashboard with room status (Free/Rented).

---

### **5. Testing**
#### Objective:
- Ensure all components and APIs work correctly.
1. **Frontend Testing**:
   - Use tools like **React Testing Library** or **Cypress** for UI testing.
2. **Backend Testing**:
   - Use **Postman** or **Swagger** for manual API testing.
   - Write automated tests with **Mocha** or **Jest**.
3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Simulate end-to-end user flows:
     - Tenant searching for a room.
     - Owner adding a room listing.

---

### **6. Deployment**
#### Objective:
- Make the application accessible to users.
1. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Deploy React using **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or **AWS Amplify**.
2. **Backend Deployment**:
   - Deploy Express.js using **Heroku**, **AWS EC2**, or **Render**.
   - Set up SSL for secure communication.
3. **Database Hosting**:
   - Host the database on **AWS RDS**, **Google Cloud SQL**, or similar services.
4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Use `.env` files or secret managers for sensitive configuration (e.g., API keys).

---

### **7. Maintenance and Future Enhancements**
#### Objective:
- Ensure smooth performance and add new features.
1. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Use **Google Analytics** for frontend performance.
   - Use **PM2** or **New Relic** for backend monitoring.
2. **User Feedback**:
   - Implement a feedback feature to collect suggestions and bug reports.
3. **Scalability**:
   - Optimize database queries.
   - Cache frequently accessed data using **Redis**.

---

### **Timeline (Estimation)**
- **Week 1-2**: Backend APIs and database design.
- **Week 3-4**: Frontend development (UI components).
- **Week 5**: Backend-frontend integration.
- **Week 6**: Testing and debugging.
- **Week 7**: Deployment and user feedback collection.
