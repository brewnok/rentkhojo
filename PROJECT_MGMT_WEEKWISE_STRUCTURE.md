   - **Tenants**: Retrieve available rooms.
   - **Owners**: Add, update, and delete room entries.
   - Add file upload functionality using Multer.
3. Integrate the database using Sequelize:
   - Configure models for **Owner**, **Tenat**, and **RoomsTable**..
   - Test basic database operations.

#### **DBA**:
1. Write optimized SQL queries or stored procedures for critical operations (if necessary).
2. Ensure indexing on key fields (e.g., `owner_id`, `room_id`, `status`).

### **Week 3: Frontend Setup**
#### **Frontend Engineer**:
1. Set up the **React.js** project using `create-react-app` or Vite.
2. Install libraries:
   - `react-router-dom` (for routing).
   - UI libraries like Material-UI or Tailwind CSS.
   - Axios or Fetch API for API calls.
3. Create reusable components:
   - Header, Footer, and common buttons.
   - Authentication forms (login/register).
4. Design a responsive layout for:
   - Tenant search page.
   - Owner dashboard.

#### **Backend Engineer**:
1. Integrate Swagger or Postman documentation for APIs.
2. Set up backend error handling for clean API responses.
3. Deploy a basic API version (e.g., on Heroku or Render) for testing.

---

### **Week 4: Database Testing and Frontend Integration**
#### **Frontend Engineer**:
1. Build **Tenant Features**:
   - Search room functionality: Fetch data from the API and display results in a card layout.
   - Room detail page: Display photos, owner contact, and rent details.
2. Build **Owner Features**:
   - Add room form: Create a form for owners to upload room details and photos.
   - Dashboard: Fetch and display the owner's room list with edit/delete functionality.

#### **Backend Engineer**:
1. Test API endpoints with Postman or Insomnia.
2. Fix bugs or optimize queries based on feedback from the frontend team.
3. Add API rate limiting and security (e.g., input sanitization).

#### **DBA**:
1. Run integration tests on the database:
   - Ensure that data relationships work as expected.
   - Verify that queries perform efficiently with test data.
2. Set up automated backups for the database.

---

### **Week 5: Full Stack Integration**
#### **Frontend Engineer**:
1. Integrate APIs into React components:
   - Use Axios/Fetch API to connect frontend with backend.
   - Add loading spinners and error handling for API calls.
2. Complete authentication flow:
   - Add authentication API for authenticating login information provided by tenat/owner
   - Redirect users based on roles (tenant/owner).
3. Finalize Owner Dashboard:
   - Test image upload functionality.

#### **Backend Engineer**:
1. Implement advanced features:
   - Search filters (e.g., by location, room type, or price range).
   - Geolocation integration for latitude/longitude (if required).
2. Optimize file handling:
   - Ensure photos are stored in AWS S3 or another cloud storage provider.
3. Write unit tests for critical APIs (e.g., authentication, room search).

#### **DBA**:
1. Stress-test the database with sample data.
2. Review the backend queries for further optimizations.

### **Week 6: Testing and Debugging**
#### **Frontend Engineer**:
1. Conduct UI/UX testing:
   - Ensure the UI works seamlessly on mobile and desktop.
   - Fix layout or responsiveness issues.
2. Write frontend tests using:
   - React Testing Library or Jest for unit testing.
   - Cypress for end-to-end testing.

#### **Backend Engineer**:
1. Perform API load testing using tools like Postman or JMeter.
2. Fix security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, CORS issues).

#### **DBA**:
1. Monitor query execution plans to detect performance bottlenecks.
2. Finalize database indexes and constraints.

---

### **Week 7: Deployment**
#### **Frontend Engineer**:
1. Deploy React app:
   - Use platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify.
   - Ensure environment variables are correctly set for production APIs.
2. Perform browser compatibility testing.

#### **Backend Engineer**:
